### About Me

My name is Brandon Stevens, and I'm a software engineer from Southern California. I focus heavily on product integration and making the lives of users easier. I have devoted the last 4 years of my life to DeepWater Exploration, a subsea computer vision company that is quickly shaping the industry. As the Chief Product Officer, it is my job to make product integration possible, regardless of the system.

I've worked on some interesting passion projects in the past as well. Software engineering has remained my passion since I was young, and I am so excited to see how it expands in the future.

### Featured Projects

#### [DWE OS](https://github.com/DeepWaterExploration/DWE_OS)

The edge runtime for DeepWater Vision hardware. Stream, control, and record on supported hardware. Installed natively on all DWE.ai SVC modules.

#### [Chip8](https://github.com/brandonhs/Chip8)

A Chip8 interpreter and emulator I wrote in a day using some unique code structuring techniques.

#### [Astraios](https://github.com/brandonhs/Astraios-Engine)

A Java game engine I wrote years ago that lacks much major functionality, yet serves as a testimate to my passion for anything and everything low-level.

#### [BrandOS](https://github.com/brandonhs/BrandOS)

An exploration into operating systems. While the use cases of this are limited to almost nothing, what I learned from this project is what has enabled me to create what I do now. Without this project, my tinkering with the Linux kernel would never have been possible.

#### [MJPEG-Streamer](https://github.com/brandonhs/MJPEG-Streamer)

The first library I ever made. This is what got me interested in the world of real-time low latency streaming systems over a network -- something I use heavily at DWE.
